I'll explain how to use readelf to analyze ELF files and memory allocation in Linux.

readelf is a powerful tool for analyzing ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files, which are the standard binary format for executables, object code, and shared libraries in Linux.

Here are the key readelf commands for memory and allocation analysis:

1. View Program Headers (segments):
```bash
readelf -l executable
```
This shows segment information including:
- Memory permissions (read/write/execute)
- Virtual addresses
- Segment sizes and alignment
- Segment types (LOAD, DYNAMIC, etc.)

2. View Section Headers:
```bash
readelf -S executable
```
This displays:
- Section names and types
- Memory addresses
- Section sizes
- Section flags (allocatable, writable, executable)

3. Analyze dynamic section and dependencies:
```bash
readelf -d executable
```
Shows:
- Shared library dependencies
- Runtime path information
- Symbol versioning
- Other dynamic linking information

4. View symbol tables:
```bash
readelf -s executable
```
Displays:
- Global and local symbols
- Symbol sizes and types
- Symbol bindings (local/global/weak)
- Symbol visibility

For investigating ELF files in detail:

1. View file header information:
```bash
readelf -h executable
```
Shows:
- ELF class (32/64-bit)
- Entry point address
- Machine architecture
- File type

2. View relocation entries:
```bash
readelf -r executable
```
Shows how the dynamic linker needs to modify the program for loading.

3. Examine notes section:
```bash
readelf -n executable
```
Displays additional metadata about the binary.

4. View all headers at once:
```bash
readelf -a executable
```
Comprehensive view of all ELF file information.

Practical examples for memory analysis:

1. Find the program's entry point:
```bash
readelf -h executable | grep "Entry"
```

2. Check for writable and executable segments (potential security issues):
```bash
readelf -l executable | grep "RWE"
```

3. Analyze memory layout:
```bash
readelf -l executable | grep -A 5 "Program Headers"
```

4. Find loaded shared libraries:
```bash
readelf -d executable | grep "NEEDED"
```

Tips for memory allocation investigation:

1. Look for segments with RW (Read-Write) permissions to identify data sections:
```bash
readelf -l executable | grep -A 1 "RW"
```

2. Check section sizes to understand memory footprint:
```bash
readelf -S executable | grep "Size"
```

3. Analyze stack and heap-related segments:
```bash
readelf -l executable | grep -A 3 "GNU_STACK"
```

4. Examine dynamic memory allocations:
```bash
readelf -d executable | grep "PLTRELSZ\|RELSZ"
```

Common use cases:

1. Security analysis:
- Check for executable stack segments
- Identify writable and executable sections
- Analyze security-related flags

2. Debugging:
- Find symbol addresses
- Analyze relocation entries
- Examine section permissions

3. Memory optimization:
- Analyze section sizes
- Check alignment requirements
- Identify unused sections

4. Dependency analysis:
- Check required shared libraries
- Analyze dynamic linking information
- Verify symbol resolution

Remember to combine readelf with other tools like objdump, nm, and ldd for comprehensive binary analysis. The information from readelf can help you understand memory layout, identify security issues, and optimize memory usage in your programs.
