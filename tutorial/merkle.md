# What are Merkle Trees
Merkle trees are a logical way of storing data in an organised structure. In specidic a tree-like structure is used, where the bottom most layers contain actual data eg. Account balances. as we traverse the tree structure to the top of the tree each leaf is hashed with it's sibling to generate a hash value representing the data held by the two sibling nodes.
